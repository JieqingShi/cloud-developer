# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into three parts:
1. [The Simple Frontend](https://github.com/udacity/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/exercises/udacity-c2-frontend)
A basic Ionic client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backend. [Covered in the course]
2. [The RestAPI Backend](https://github.com/udacity/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/exercises/udacity-c2-restapi), a Node-Express server which can be deployed to a cloud service. [Covered in the course]
3. [The Image Filtering Microservice](https://github.com/udacity/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/project/image-filter-starter-code), the final project for the course. It is a Node-Express application which runs a simple script to process images. [Your assignment]

## Tasks

### Setup Node Environment

You'll need to create a new node server. Open a new terminal within the project directory and run:

1. Initialize a new project: `npm i`
2. run the development server with `npm run dev`

### Create a new endpoint in the server.ts file

The starter code has a task for you to complete an endpoint in `./src/server.ts` which uses query parameter to download an image from a public URL, filter the image, and return the result.

We've included a few helper functions to handle some of these concepts and we're importing it for you at the top of the `./src/server.ts`  file.

```typescript
import {filterImageFromURL, deleteLocalFiles} from './util/util';
```

### Deploying your system

Follow the process described in the course to `eb init` a new application and `eb create` a new environment to deploy your image-filter service! Don't forget you can use `eb deploy` to push changes.

## Stand Out (Optional)

### Refactor the course RESTapi

If you're feeling up to it, refactor the course RESTapi to make a request to your newly provisioned image server.

### Authentication

Prevent requests without valid authentication headers.
> !!NOTE if you choose to submit this, make sure to add the token to the postman collection and export the postman collection file to your submission so we can review!

### Custom Domain Name

Add your own domain name and have it point to the running services (try adding a subdomain name to point to the processing server)
> !NOTE: Domain names are not included in AWSâ€™ free tier and will incur a cost.

### Implementation of image filter endpoint
The image filter endpoint code is in server.ts. \
It's a GET request with image_url as a query parameter, i.e. `/filteredimage?image_url={}`.

The query parameter had to be set explicitly to type `String`, otherwise `npm run build` would fail due to an error message. \
I.e. changing `let {image_url} = req.query;` to `let image_url = req.query.image_url as string;`
(This was not a problem during local runs).

I implemented an additional URL check using the `image-validator` package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/jsonwebtoken). That is, before the image is being downloaded and filtered, we check for the validity of the url (assuming e.g. the user is providing the URL of an image that does not exist or is malformatted.) If the image URL is not successfully validated we return an 404 error message to the user. This way the user would be informed of the error. Otherwise if the image URL validation were not there, the image filter code would return an error message such as "Could not find MIME for buffer (null)", with no message being returned to the client. (Of course there are plenty of other ways of catching these types of errors)

If the image validation passes, then the image is filtered and saved locally to ./util/tmp. We then send the filtered image as a response with `res.sendFile`. Afterwards we delete the local file.


### Local deployment
The app is running locally on `localhost:8082` per default. 
Local testing can be done with Postman using the provided Postman collection file `udacity-c2-project.postman_collection.json`.

### Authentification
Added a very basic authentication feature based on the course examples. The user can send a POST request to the `/login` endpoint with "username" and "password" arguments in the request body. (Example see postman collection) This returns a JWT token that is generated based on the username and password combination. For this we use a JWT secret, that is stored in a `.env` file.

If this token is then passed in the requests authorization header then the image will be filtered. If no token is passed an error message is returned. If an invalid token is passed, the verification of the token will fail because it cannot be verified against the JWT secret.

The `/filteredimage` endpoint function signature also then needs to be updated to account for the authentication feature.


### Elastic Beanstalk deployment
Initially the deployment to Elastic Beanstalk was failing after many trials. Things I tried:

- reverting the code to not use authentication
- adding a `.npmrc` file
- adapting npm package versions according to the `udacity-c2-restapi` example
- deleting node_modules and reinstalling packages + rebuilding 

 Turns out the problem was that the `package.json` file was missing a `start` entry under `scripts`. Including a stanza like `"start": "node /var/app/current/www/server.js"` the deployment finally succeeded.

The URL of the elastic beanstalk application is: http://image-filter-with-auth-user1734469-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/


 ### Problems with some images
 Upon testing it looks the code does not work for some images. E.g. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Golden_tabby_and_white_kitten_n01.jpg 
 errors out because the image URL validation is unsuccessful. Even after disabling the image URL validation part the filter code returns an error message about "Could not find MIME for buffer (null)"

 However for other images it works fine. E.g. https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Z6ATM6x0L.jpg
